#Understanding how to best get information to viewers

As the world continues to evolve and advance with technology, getting information to one's audience gets harder and harder. Now, one must know what receivers are expecting and how to best get their data out. Whether it is programs to shy away from or platforms to use, if one truly wants success research is needed.

##Avoiding Microsoft Word

The first thing one will find may come as a shock to many. A great deal of viewers dislike Microsoft Word. Two different bloggers, Marc Scott and Charlie Stross, state on their strong feelings for the word processor; the two describe how it is hurting the release of information.

### "Why Microsoft Word must Die" Charlie Stross
Stross starts out giving the history of how Microsoft and its word program came to be. Before the company there were copious amounts of other processing tools. However, the company made moves to buy out the competition. "If confronted with a successful new type of software, Microsoft would purchase one of the leading companies in the sector and then throw resources at integrating their product into Microsoft's own ecosystem, if necessary dumping it at below cost in order to drive rivals out of business."

In addition, Microsoft would also continually force customers to upgrade their Word product. "Each new version of Word defaulted to writing a new format of file which could not be parsed by older copies of the program."

### "Please stop sending me your shitty Word documents" Marc Scott

Not only does Microsoft make it where their product, and newest version, is needed according to Stross, as Scott states it also limits viewers. As Scott concludes,sending Microsoft Word documents is being inconsiderate to the receiver(s).

>"Firstly you assume that I have Word or some clone of it installed. I know you think the words 'Computer', 'Microsoft', 'Windows' and 'Office' are synonymous, but they're not and there are plenty of people in the world who use *nix operating systems. By sending me a .docx file you're forcing me to find a work around, so that I can use your document."

By saving one's work as a .docx, one is already limiting his or her audience, or at the very least frustrating it. The author concludes saying one last thing, "Oh... and learn to write in sodding Markdown."

### "MARKDOWN: MARKUP THAT’S DOWNRIGHT SIMPLE" Erik Martin

Martin continues the subtle hint Scott issues. Instead of Microsoft Word, which some cannot open, Markdown is presents no problems for being opened by all users. As far as the actual mark-up, the language is  "simple by design." "Markdown is less cumbersome than many other markup languages."

As professor of Technical Communication in the the Department of English at Virginia Tech Carlos Evia states, "'Years ago, I started coding websites with HTML and then structuring documentation with XML, but Markdown allows me to use plain text for similar purposes. My Markdown files can become HTML and XML deliverables with one or two lines of commands or a few keystrokes."'

### "Guide to Podcasting" Vanessa Quirk

In addition to Markdown, something many have not considered using is podcasting. While growth has been slower, listeners to podcast has grown each year from 2005-2015. Arguably, even more important is the use of cellphones in relation to podcasting.
>"Americans now use their smartphones more than any other device to access the Internet—and it’s a trend that appears to be on the rise.22 Similarly, mobile listening is by far the predominant method of podcast consumption today (63 percent of Libsyn-hosted podcasts were requested from mobile devices in 2014, up from 43 percent in 2012, according to Libsyn’s internal data), and it continues to grow month by month.23 Podcasting should be considered a mobile-first medium."

### "Podcasting Timeline"
But just like learning to adapt and learn about how to best reach one's audience, one must also do further research where needed. To best understand podcasts, one should look at its history. Whether it's the first podcast being born by RSS in September 2003, the first daily podcast by Public Radio International in February 2005, and subscription podcasts emerging in May 2007-- one will need to reach an audience through podcasting and it could easily turn a profit.

#Recap

One has to do research on how to best reach the greatest audience. By failing to understand how Microsoft Word can limit viewers will hurt the creator. Instead, Markdown can be a simple language to encompass all. In addition, by not realizing the need to podcast can have one miss out on the present and future, as more people use their phones. The last mistake can also cost money too, as podcasting becomes more and more popular.
